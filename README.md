This is an exercise from the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks): <br />
*Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.*
